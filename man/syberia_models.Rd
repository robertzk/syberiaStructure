\title{Find all the model objects in a Syberia project.}
\usage{
syberia_models(pattern = "", env = c("dev", "prod"),
  root = syberia_root(), by_mtime = TRUE, fixed = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{pattern}{character. A set of characters by which to filter.
This uses the same format as the popular ctrl+p plugin for vim.
Namely, it will look for adjacent instances of such characters
regardless of any interpolating characters. For example,
'ace' will match 'abcde' but also 'abcdfghe' but not 'aebcd'.}

\item{env}{character. The syberia environment (e.g., \code{'dev'} or
\code{'prod'}. The default is \code{c('dev', 'prod')}.}

\item{root}{character. The root of the syberia project. The default
is \code{syberia_root()}.}

\item{by_mtime}{logical. Whether or not to sort the models in descending
order by last modified time. The default is \code{TRUE}.}

\item{fixed}{logical. Whether or not to use smart interpolation, like in
the description for the \code{pattern} argument. If \code{TRUE},
only substring matching is used.}
}
\value{
a list of filenames containing syberia models
}
\description{
The convention is that model files have the same name
as the directory they are contained in (this allows other
files in the same directory to be used as helper files).
If no such file exists in a directory, all files are
assumed to be model files. For example, if we have
}
\details{
default/en-US/model1.r
default/en-US/model2/model2.r
default/en-US/model2/helper.r

only the first two will be considered to be model objects.
If there was a default/en-US/en-US.r, then the first would
no longer be considered a model object (it would be considered
a file with helper functions).
