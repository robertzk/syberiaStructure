\title{Fetch info about a file relative to a syberia directory.}
\usage{
syberia_resource(filename, root = syberia_root(), provides = list(),
  body = TRUE, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{filename}{character. The filename of the R script to execute
relative to a syberia project.}

\item{root}{character. The root of the syberia project in which to
look for \code{filename}. The default is \code{syberia_root()}.}

\item{provides}{list or environment. A list or environment of values
to provide to the file.}

\item{body}{logical. Whether or not the fetch the body of the file
in the `current` and `cached` output lists.}

\item{...}{additional arguments to pass to the \code{base::source}
function that gets executed when the `value` is accessed.}
}
\value{
a four-element list with names `current`, `cached`, `value`,
  and `modified`. The former two will both be two-element lists containing
  keys `info` and `body` (unless Syberia has never executed the file before
  in which case the latter will be \code{NULL}). The `info` key holds the
  result of calling R's built-in \code{file.info} on the file (and includes
  information like created at and modified at time), whereas the `body`
  key holds a character representation of the body of the file (useful
  for comparing if any actual modifications have been made).

  The `value` key in the returned list holds a function which will
  execute the given file in the \code{provides} environment. A function
  is returned instead of the actual value to let the caller control
  whether or not the file is executed (e.g., based on its properties
  in the `current` list). Most frequently, this means consulting the
  `modified` key of the returned list, which will hold a logical
  indicating whether or not the file has been modified since last
  executed by Syberia (if this was never the case, `modified` will
  be \code{FALSE}).
}
\description{
Some additional information will be returned. Namely, a list with
four keys, `current`, `cached`, `value`, and `modified`.
The former two will contain information relating to the current
and previous execution of this file, while `value` contains
a function that will execute the file and return its output,
and `modified` is a logical flag indicating whether or not the
file has been modified since it was last executed by Syberia.
}
\details{
Internally, the cached information about the file is stored in the
syberia project's registry under the key \code{resources/resource_cache}.
